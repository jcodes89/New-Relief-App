- **Volunteer Profile:** Volunteer users can view their individual profile information.
- **Frontend:** Built with React and HTML for a dynamic user interface with smooth animations using GSAP.

### Technologies Used:
- **Next.js:** Utilized for server-side rendering and easy React application setup.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage.
- **Prisma.io:** Integrated for efficient database interactions and ORM.
